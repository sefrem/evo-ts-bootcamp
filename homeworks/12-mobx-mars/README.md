Now with MobX.

An example of routing is made with MobX. In a real-world project I would use something more conventional like react-router but as this is 
a MobX homework after all, I decided to go all the way with it.

P.S. In this case I'm pushing .env to repo in order for the app to work on netlify. Normally I wouldn't do that.

Run locally with

### `yarn start`
